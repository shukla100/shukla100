Hi, I'm Garima — a Product Manager with a background building internal RPA (robotic process automation) and AI/ML-driven platforms in fintech.
</p>

<p>
While my 9-to-5 centers around enterprise-scale problems, I’ve always been drawn to user-first problem solving. 
</p>
<p>
As a photographer myself, I kept losing hours to exhaustive location-scouting to capture the perfect image. I built PhotoWhere as a geo-tag–driven app to solve that — streamlining location discovery for photographers through real-time API data and dynamic filtering.

<h3>PhotoWhere - iOS mobile application</b> </h3>
<p>
PhotoWhere is a passion project I designed, built and launched on the iOS App Store. This repo outlines how I took an idea — from concept to live app: including the problem, feature prioritization, wireframes & mockups, MVP1 build, customer feedback, and MVP2 roadmap.
