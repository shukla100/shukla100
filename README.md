Hi, I'm Garima — a Product Manager with background building internal RPA (robotic process automation) and AI/ML systems in fintech.

<p>
I'm drawn to building from ground up, specifically in startup environments, with a focus on creating meaningful, user-centered products.

<h3>PhotoWhere - a native iOS mobile application </b> </h3>
<p>
As a photographer myself, I was losing hours in location-scouting to capture the perfect image. I built PhotoWhere as a geo-tag–driven app to solve that — streamlining location discovery for photographers through real-time API data and dynamic filtering.
